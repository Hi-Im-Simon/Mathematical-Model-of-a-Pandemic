# A Mathematical Model of a Pandemic
This project's aim is to model the progression of a pandemic in a population given certain initial parameters. In order to accomplish this, a basic SIR model[^1] has been used to design a new model that is able to predict the progression of a pandemic within defined accuracy. The system is modelled after the COVID-19 pandemic, although its modularity allows it to be used in other circumstances.

## Variables
The SIRD model (_Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased_) divides the total population _N_ into following compartments:
* Susceptible compartment,
* Infected compartment,
* Recovered compartment,
* Deceased compartment.
