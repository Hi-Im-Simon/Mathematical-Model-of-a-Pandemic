## A Mathematical Model of a Pandemic
This project's aim is to model the progression of a pandemic in a population given certain initial parameters. In order to accomplish this, differential equations based on a COVID-19 pandemic mathematical model were used.[^1] Variables, parameters and differential equations are at the moment temporary and are subject to change once a more accurate model is found for the purposes of this project.
